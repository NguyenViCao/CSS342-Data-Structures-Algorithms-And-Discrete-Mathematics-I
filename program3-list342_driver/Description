You will build a class for a fully ordered list.  The list class, called List342, will be templatized so 
that different types of objects can be stored in it. 
 
 List342<string> some_strings; 
 List342<int> list_of_integers; 
 List342<Child> children; 
 List342<MyRandomObj> ordered_list_random_objs; 
 
The following member functions should be created for the List342 class.
